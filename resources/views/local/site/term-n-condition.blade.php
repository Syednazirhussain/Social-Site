            <h2>Respect the law</h2>
            <p>It is critical that you show proper respect for the law generally, 
                and specifically for the laws governing copyright and fair use of 
                copyrighted material. You should not quote more than short excerpts 
                from someone else’s work. It is good general practice to link to others’ 
                work. Use appropriate symbols to mark the first appearance of trademarked 
                terms in your content. Do not post images, music or other copyrighted 
                content unless you own them or have permission from the owner to display 
                such content in this context. Keep in mind that the laws may differ depending 
                on where you live.

            <h2>Treat others like you want to be treated</h2>
            <p>Be respectful of others’ opinions and beliefs. 
                Use common courtesy when posting content: refrain from abusive, 
                obscene, or offensive language, images, or links. Do not post content 
                from, or links to, Internet sites that feature sexual content, gambling, 
                or that advocate intolerance of others; and do not create such content 
                on CommScope’s Social Networks
